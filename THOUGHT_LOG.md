# Thought Log

Research reflections for the depth-routing experiment.

Purpose:

- capture the qualitative feel of the experiment as it unfolds
- preserve hunches, predictions, guesses, and competing hypotheses
- note surprises, tensions, weird facts, and confidence shifts
- leave behind a readable reflective trail for the end-of-project write-up

Important rule:

- entries here are not claim-bearing evidence
- use this file for research reflections, intuitions, and interesting facts
- validated conclusions still belong in `CURRENT_STATE.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, run artifacts, and the prereg-aware result docs
- useful sidecar research findings belong here if they help preserve why a tangential paper, result, or intuition seemed important at the time

## Working Hypotheses

- [ ] Confirm that oracle-alpha beats uniform routing on the preregistered Phase 1 gate before any interpretability claims.
- [ ] Operationalize all Figure 8 predictions before inspecting heatmaps.
- [ ] Compare softmax-constrained routing against unconstrained and top-k regimes using matched initialization.
- [ ] Design the tool-breakage demonstration around a concrete factual recall circuit on Gemma-2-2B.
- [ ] Treat learned router query vectors as the closest `w_l` analog and define their geometry analysis.
- [ ] Test whether hierarchical clustering reveals approximately `8 clusters` consistent with the Block AttnRes story.
- [ ] Check whether refusal or honesty-related SAE features correspond to distinct routing patterns.

## Hunches and Guesses

- The strongest invalidation risk is overclaiming from frozen-model routing optimization.
- The strongest differentiation opportunity is the combination of tool-breakage, Figure 8 validation, and safety routing analysis.
- The first real implementation bugs are more likely to come from reconstruction and normalization mistakes than from the optimizer itself.

## Feel of the Experiment

- The project looks strongest when framed as recovering an effective depth mixture rather than claiming hidden trained routers.
- The paper path likely depends more on methodological discipline than on finding a flashy first positive result.

## Predictions

- The first feasibility tranche will probably show non-uniform routing before it shows especially clean block structure.
- The safety lane will likely bottleneck on feature validation rather than on routing analysis.

## Surprises and Tensions

- The most differentiated part of the thesis is still the tool-breakage lane, but it is also the easiest lane to overstate.
- Figure 8 is a useful prediction surface, but strong trained-routing match claims still need a reproducible proxy.

## Interesting facts

- Figure 8 in `research/Attention_Residuals.pdf` explicitly names diagonal dominance, embedding persistence, layer specialization, learned skip connections, and Block AttnRes preserving the structure with `N = 8`.
- The strongest current reviewer-facing additions are stability, out-of-sample predictiveness, and harmfulness-versus-refusal separation.

## [2026-03-16T20:55:51-0500] Dependency Freeze And First Validation Slice
- Stage: implementation
- Feel of the Experiment: The dependency freeze was cleaner than expected. The work still feels fragile, but the fragility has moved from packaging risk toward model-hooking and cache-extraction risk, which is the right direction.
- Working Hypotheses:
  - The first serious implementation failures are still most likely to be normalization or cache-accounting mistakes rather than optimizer pathologies.
- Hunches and Guesses:
  - Python 3.14 is probably not the immediate source of trouble for this repo, at least on this machine, even though I expected it to be more hostile.
- Predictions:
  - The next real snag will likely be extracting the exact sublayer outputs we need from the development model while preserving a reconstruction identity within tolerance.
- Surprises and Tensions:
  - The install path for the pinned Phase 1 stack was materially smoother than expected, but that does not buy much scientific confidence by itself.
  - A toy reconstruction module is useful as a tripwire, but it is also dangerously easy to overestimate; the real gate is model-backed validation.
- Confidence:
  - medium in the environment freeze being stable enough for Phase 1
  - low-to-medium that the first model-backed reconstruction pass will be clean on the first try
- Interesting facts:
  - `torch.backends.mps.is_available()` is `True` in the pinned `.venv`, so the local backend assumption is now checked rather than merely stated.
  - The current validation tests encode the two easiest mistakes to make: comparing uniform routing to `logits / L` and pretending per-source normalization is exact.
